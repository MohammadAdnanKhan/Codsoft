## Task 1:-
### TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION - This Project explores the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 through the lens of machine learning. We'll delve into the passenger data, uncovering patterns and relationships between various factors like passenger class, gender, age, and travel arrangements, and their potential influence on survival rates. By building a Support Vector Machine (SVC) model, we aim to predict survival outcomes based on these features, gaining insights into the factors that may have played a role in this historical disaster.

## Task 2:-
### IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION - This Project explores machine learning classification with the Iris flower dataset. It aims to build a model that can predict the species (Iris versicolor, Iris setosa, or Iris virginica) of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Task 3:-
