## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Task 1:-
### üõ≥Ô∏è TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION - This Project explores the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 through the lens of machine learning. We'll delve into the passenger data, uncovering patterns and relationships between various factors like passenger class, gender, age, and travel arrangements, and their potential influence on survival rates. By building a Support Vector Machine (SVC) model and a Logistic regression Model, we aim to predict survival outcomes based on these features, gaining insights into the factors that may have played a role in this historical disaster. Explore the notebook to discover new insights.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task 2:-
### üå∑IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION - This Project explores machine learning classification with the Iris flower dataset. It aims to build a model that can predict the species (Iris versicolor, Iris setosa, or Iris virginica) of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Task 3:- 
### üí∞SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON - This Project will guide you through the exciting world of sales prediction using machine learning in Python. We'll delve into the world of data science and explore how it empowers businesses to optimize advertising strategies. By leveraging the power of Python libraries, we'll build a sales prediction model that considers various factors influencing customer purchases. This model will be instrumental in making informed decisions about advertising costs and maximizing your sales potential. So, buckle up and get ready to embark on this data-driven adventure! I have used two models i.e. Linear Regression and SVM. Explore the notebook to find the results.
